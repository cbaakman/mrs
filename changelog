Changes in MRS version 6

- Single file databanks have been replaced with one directory per databank.
- There's only one executable left: m6. This executable takes as first
  parameter a command name and then options for the specific command.
- The tokenizer has changed slightly to optimize recall.
- Configuration is done in just one, xml file. This can be edited using the
  admin interface in the web application.
- Only one server instance and only one IP port used.
- Makefile have been replaced by a scheduler inside the web application.
- Parser files have been simplified, they now only contain all that's needed
  for parsing and nothing more. The configuration previously done has moved
  to the single configuration file.
- The web app no longer formats entries, this is now done by formatters
  written in JavaScript and handled by the browser.
- NCBI blast support has been dropped, the MRS blast code has been optimized
  and works on FastA files directly.
