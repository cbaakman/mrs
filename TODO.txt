- Query Parser: e.q. 'crambin-like' goes wrong

- SOAP services (alleen blast nog)
- links

Choices:

- Joined databanks? Aliases?
- near operator, how to implement? new query language?
- configuration: store in xml config file, use sqlite, or both?

Basic:

- Blast
	- store original def line of FastA file to be able to find databank
	  or create alias system in config?
	- Admin page to clear cache
	- automatic clean cache

- Set up testing framework
- Status pages

Indexing:

- Replacement for makefiles
- feed header to parser scripts

Search:

- Too many alternatives
- optional suggestions dropdown
- Fix highlighting search terms when search term is a 'string'
